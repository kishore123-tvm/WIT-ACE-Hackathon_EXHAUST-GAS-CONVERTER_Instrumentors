Detail Description:

Exhaust Gas from vehicles is a major source for 66 Per Cent Of Air Pollution-Related Deaths In India, so our solution is to control Air pollution ( Exhaust gas) from the heavy load vehicles, In future we are implementing our solution for Industries which means to control 100% of air pollution
The main motive of our project is to control air pollution from Heavy loaded vehicle exhaust and  converting  it into liquid form. The converted form of liquid is used for various purposes.

The following are the major pollutants from Heavy loaded vehicles:
Nitrogen oxides (NOx). ...
Carbon monoxide (CO). ...
Sulfur dioxide (SO2). ...
Greenhouse gases.

The Exhaust gas from the vehicle is collected in a container with the help of gas tube which is placed in the Upper part of the vehicle. 
The container is called Exhaust gas cool container which cools the gas frequently.the amount of Exhausted air collected by the container is measured by use of mq2 sensor. When the container is full the mq2 sensor alerts the driver with beep sound. 
The gas filled container is detached from the vehicle and that is stored in the long gas container which is place in the petrol bunk.The gas from the long container is inserted in the EGC machine(EXHAUST GAS CONVETER) in Ecg machine we seprated into three compartment called cooling compartment, Heating compartment, cooling compartment.
Egc machine is used for converting  gas into liquid form under internal cooling and heating.for cooling purpose we are used Refrigerator and for heating purpose we are using coil heater in betwee the two layers we are using scrubber.
The liquified gas is heated and other gases pumped into the pipe and compressed in a cylinder user for other purpose like (go gas). The remaining water is filtered (reverse osmosis) and user used for various purposes.
In future we are implementing our solution for Industries which means to control 100% of air pollution
